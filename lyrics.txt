There was a pirate rich in gold
And the name of the pirate was Billy the Bold
He hid his map pieces all around
And dug his gold down low

Soon may we find his gold
So we'll be rich as we grow old
Some day when the digging is done
We'll take our loot and go

Four captains heard, full of greed
And made for the island at maximum speed
For they belonged the the pirate's creed
to see that golden glow

Soon may we find his gold
So we'll be rich as we grow old
Some day when the digging is done
We'll take our loot and go

For forty days or even more 
The pirates dug around the shore
Each empty hole caused a roar
As they dug down below

Soon may we find his gold
So we'll be rich as we grow old
Some day when the digging is done
We'll take our loot and go

As far as I've heard, the digging goes on
With holes everywhere and the gold not found
But the pirates still can smell the gold
So they'll be there until they're old

Soon may we find his gold
So we'll be rich as we grow old
Some day when the digging is done
We'll take our loot and go
